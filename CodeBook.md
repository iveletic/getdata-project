The tidy data set was created based on *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set* from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was an experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years, where each person performed 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the experiment captured several measurements (3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50 Hz), and the obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For this data set, training and test data were merged into a single dataset from which the averages of all means and standard deviations were calculated, grouped by subject and activity. The end result contains 68 columns (2 identifiers and 66 variables), which are described below:
